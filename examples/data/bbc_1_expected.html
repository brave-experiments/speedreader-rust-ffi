Just because they're sitting there and they've promoted it, doesn't always mean that they like it or that you would like it."</p><p>Alfie says that for many social media strategists and their clients, authenticity is important. </p><p>When it's not, mistakes can happen - like when Little Mix copied and pasted instructions into a post promoting their own perfume.</p><figure><span></span></figure><p>But whether it's a girl group or an influencer getting engaged, Alfie says it's important to remember there's always a distance between the famous people and their followers.</p><p>"It's really important to remember that you're not actually friends with them in real life," Alfie says. </p><p>"It's not a real life relationship where you can actually say you take something away from it."</p><figure><span></span></figure><figure><span></span></figure><p><i>Follow Newsbeat on </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsbeat/">Instagram</a><i>, </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcnewsbeat/">Facebook</a><i>, </i><a href="https://twitter.com/BBCNewsbeat">Twitter</a><i> and </i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe1Ef-K5jpnRsmVY5hCBhOw">YouTube</a><i>.</i></p><p><i>Listen to Newsbeat </i><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_radio_one">live</a><i> at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back </i><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006wkry/episodes/player">here</a>.</p>
